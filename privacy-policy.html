                <h3>5. Privacy Policy for deployment and use of Firebase and the Google Cloud Platform</h3>
                <p>
                    Our app uses Google Firebase technology (Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, “Google”). 
                    Firebase is part of Google Cloud Platform and offers many services to developers. 
                    A list can be found here: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/terms</a>. 
                    Some Firebase services process personal information. 
                    In most cases, the personal data is limited to so-called “instance IDs”, which are provided with a time stamp. 
                    Firebase’s instance IDs are unique and thus allow the linking of different events or processes. These data are neither personally identifiable informations nor do we make any effort to personalize it afterwards. 
                    We process this aggregated data to analyze and optimize usage behavior and app functionality.

                    We do not use Firebase services that use personally identifiable information, such as IP addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers or passwords. 
                    For more information about Firebase’s privacy and security, please visit <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/</a>. 
                    If possible, we use servers with a location within the EU. However, it can not be ruled out that data may also be transferred to the USA. 
                    Google has joined the EU-US Privacy Shield, a data protection agreement between the EU and the US. 
                    For more information on Google Firebase and privacy, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com</a>.
